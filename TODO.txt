Bind service definition
-----------------------

Need an /etc/init.d/ style service start definition.

Must also be able to intelligently start the log analyser.

Install and How To Docs
-----------------------

Need and installer for rpz-log-analysis.

Need a how to for configuring the Bind and Apache logs
on which it dependes.

Reporting
---------

Need to have a defined set of standard queries (view
definitions) for:

- who is a dumb user (lots of Web logs corresponding to 
  DNS logs)
- who is infected (lots of DNS logs, with little correspoding
  Web logs)
- Who is both infected and dumb (lots of both logs, but
  little correlation between many DNS logs and a Web log)

Reporting:  Ideas
``````````````````

Within a period of time select ip_address, count(*) (group by)
so you have the number of times for the IP address (for each
table).

Then you need the ones that match (dumb user) and the ones
that dont (the difference) ie. infected, correlated in time.

(more to it ...)


Putting it all together
-----------------------

A web-site that shows the analysis.  Download reports in
standardised form.
